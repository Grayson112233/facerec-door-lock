### Virtual Environment
It is strongly recommended to use a Python virtual environment. To create a virtual env, use the `venv` feature of python3.
Run the command below in the root project directory. Recommended folder name for the virtual environment is `env`.
```
python3 -m venv <env-folder-name>
```

To activate that virtual environment, use the below command:
```
source <env-folder-name>/bin/activate
```

After activating, to install the dependencies run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
